# Board_of_Nursing_Scrape

The website used for this scraping project is the [Arkansas Board of Nursing](https://www.ark.org/arsbn/statuswatch/index.php/nurse/search).

The following information is collected for all nurses with names containing the 'zach':
* License Number
* Name
* License Status
* License Type
* Expiration Date

Though I have previous Python experience, this is my first time scraping a website. If you're interested, some of the free onlnie materials I used to learn this are linked below.
